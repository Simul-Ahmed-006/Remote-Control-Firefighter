# Fire-Fighting Robot Controlled via Bluetooth

This project is a fire-fighting robot that can be controlled using a Bluetooth connection with a smartphone. The robot is equipped with a water pump to extinguish fires and can be maneuvered remotely. Below are the key features and components used in this project.

## Features:
- **Bluetooth Control:** The robot can be controlled using a smartphone via Bluetooth communication.

- **Fire Detection:** It uses heat sensors (LS, MS, RS) to detect fires.

- **Motor Control:** The robot has motor drivers (IN1R, IN2R, IN3L, IN4L) to control its movement.

- **Servo Control:** A servo motor (s1) is used to aim the water pump.

- **Pump Control:** The water pump (pump) can be turned on to extinguish fires.

## Usage:
1. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board.

2. Power on the robot and establish a Bluetooth connection with your smartphone.

3. Use a Bluetooth terminal app on your smartphone to send commands (1, 2, 3, 4) for controlling the robot's movement.

4. The robot will move according to the commands and use the servo motor to aim the water pump at detected fires.
